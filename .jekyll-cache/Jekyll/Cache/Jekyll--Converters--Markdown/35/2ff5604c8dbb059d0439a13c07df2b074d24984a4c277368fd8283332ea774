I"ÿ<p>One of the most valuable indicators about teaching quality at universities is the Student-to-Faculty ratio which is the number of students per one member of staff. The lower the number the better for it give the tutor smaller group of students mentor and hence more focused and detailed feedback.</p>

<p>Top ranking universities have ratios near to 6 (i.e. for every 6 students, there is one professor). The question now is: can we make up an educational system where the ratio lower than that? can we reach a ratio of 1 where each student has a dedicated professor! Well, this what AI promises to provide in the field of education.</p>

<p>AI has transformed wide range of industries. Common examples are image recognition, self-driving cars and voice recognition. However, a less popular example is the application of AI in education. This application is growing rapidly and once it kicks in, it will make drastic change to humans‚Äô ability to process information and humans‚Äô intellectual as a whole.</p>

<p>So, what is the application of AI in education? The answer is: there are a lot of applications. The one that interests me is <em>Personalized Learning</em>.</p>

<h2 id="personalized-learning">Personalized Learning</h2>
<p class="notice">‚ÄúPersonalized Learning is an educational approach that aims to customize learning for each student‚Äôs strengths, needs, skills and interests. Each student gets a learning plan that‚Äôs based on what he knows and how he learns best.‚Äù</p>

<p>In other words, personalized learning ultimate goal is to customize the learning experience so that it is most efficient for each student. Now, human tutor can achieve decent level of personalized learning for small group of students, However, using AI can push these experience beyond the limits that we have ever imagined in all human history.</p>

<p>The main power of AI comes from its ability to give answers to questions that needs focus observation of gigantic number of students. For example, here are some questions that AI can answer with accuracy more than any tutor can get.<br />
 given a particular student:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>‚Ä¢ What is the best pace?</li>
    <li>‚Ä¢ What is the best style of learning?</li>
    <li>‚Ä¢ What is the best quantity?</li>
    <li>‚Ä¢ What are the most probable mistakes he/she will make?</li>
    <li>‚Ä¢ How many time should he/she revise a concept?</li>
    <li>‚Ä¢ How much time between revisions?</li>
    <li>‚Ä¢ What motivates that students ?</li>
    <li>‚Ä¢ What makes him/her focus or get distracted?</li>
    <li>‚Ä¢ Is it better for this student to be an early bird or a night owl?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer to these questions for each individual is, with no doubt, of a great value that can make him/her get the most out of his learning.</p>

<h2 id="effects-on-society">Effects on Society</h2>
<p>Any method that enhances the learning experience has a positive effect on society. Using AI, however, has its unique positive effects. Let‚Äôs see some of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Less years educational systems:</strong> Efficient learning will get students ready with the basic skills of markets in less time than usual. It won‚Äôt be uncommon to see a 12-year-old students equipped with the knowledge of what was normal to be gained by a 26-year master student before the era of AI!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Easier access to quality education:</strong> Two of the most known barriers of online learning are lack of engagement and the language barrier. Fortunately, AI can solve the former problem by creating smart content that makes the student enthusiastic the whole time. Also, for the language problem, machine translation now is a very hot field that will make courses from all around the world available at all other languages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>More Flexibility:</strong> At the moment of writing this article, the world has been hit hard by the outbreak of Corona virus. Educational institutes, even the top ones, are facing a great challenge to continue delivering quality education while students are in quarantine. Personalized Learning enhances the online learning experience, hence it aids in facing global challenges like the one we are facing right now.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In general, when education is improved, this leads to higher public awareness and faster production to countries which makes for better economy.</p>

<h2 id="when-will-we-see-these-effects">When Will We See These Effects?</h2>
<p>It is already happening on small scales. Chat pots are already used in some schools and administrative tasks are being automated in some universities. But to see the results that make us ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù, we need to wait a little bit more. The obstacle that hinders AI algorithms is the lack of data. Data is like oxygen to AI models, and without it, AI algorithms cannot do its best. unlike applications who have data available right away in mass quantities such as images and sounds, Personal data required for AI application in education is not that much available. So we will have to wait (or better) deliberately collect these data so that AI wheel starts cycling.</p>

<h2 id="last-but-not-least-">Last But Not Least ‚Ä¶</h2>
<p>AI is changing the world rapidly in an unprecedented way in human history. A newly born baby today will almost certainly have different educational system than that was taken by his/her parents.</p>

<p>Similar to any technological breakthroughs, we have the choice to use it for good or bad. You, dear reader, better use it for good, and for making our world a better place.</p>
