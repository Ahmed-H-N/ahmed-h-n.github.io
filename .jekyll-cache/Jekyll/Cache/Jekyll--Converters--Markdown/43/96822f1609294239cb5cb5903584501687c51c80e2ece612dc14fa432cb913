I"¾<p>I made this blog to share my thoughts on Machine Learning, Software Engineering, Natural Language Processing, Arabic Languge and Animation. Animation seems to be not related to the group, but I really think that animation is the right way to bring any dull concept to life.</p>

<p>To me, these fields are like art. They have some sort of beautful harmony. All I have to do is to grab my brush (actually my computer), and start painting!</p>
